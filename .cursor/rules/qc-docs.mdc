# Documentation Quality Check

Evaluate documentation as if you're a new developer joining tomorrow.

## Review Perspective

Imagine you're a senior engineer starting fresh on this codebase:
- You've never seen this project before
- You need to be productive in 2 hours
- You might get paged at 3am for incidents
- You need to ship a feature next week

**What documentation do you need? What's missing? What's misleading?**

## Documentation Categories

- [ ] How to run tests
- [ ] Project structure overview
- [ ] Where to go next

**Issues to identify:**

2. 
3. 

**Time to working environment:** ___ minutes/hours

### 3. Architecture Documentation

**Should exist:**
- [ ] High-level architecture diagram
- [ ] Major components and their responsibilities
- [ ] Data flow diagrams
- [ ] State management approach
- [ ] Key design decisions (ADRs)
- [ ] Technology stack and why
- [ ] Integration points

**Questions to answer:**
- How is the app structured?
- Where does business logic live?
- How does data flow through the system?
- What external services do we integrate with?
- What's the navigation structure?
- Where are the performance-critical paths?

**Missing architecture docs:**
- 
- 

**Confusing areas:**
- 

### 4. API Documentation

**For each API/endpoint:**
- [ ] Purpose/description
- [ ] Request format
- [ ] Response format
- [ ] Authentication requirements
- [ ] Error responses
- [ ] Rate limits
- [ ] Example requests

**Assessment:**
- Is API documented: Yes/No/Partial
- Format: OpenAPI/Swagger/Markdown/Comments/None
- Up-to-date: Yes/No
- Examples work: Yes/No/Untested

**Issues:**
- Undocumented endpoints:
- Outdated documentation:
- Missing error codes:
- No authentication docs:

### 5. Code Comments

**Comment quality:**
- [ ] Complex logic explained
- [ ] "Why" not "what" comments
- [ ] No outdated comments
- [ ] No commented-out code
- [ ] Public APIs have JSDoc/TSDoc

**Identify problems:**

**Missing comments where needed:**
- Complex algorithms unexplained
- Non-obvious business logic
- Magic numbers without context
- Workarounds without explanation

**Bad comments:**
- Obvious comments (`// increment i`)
- Outdated comments (contradict code)
- Commented-out code still present
- TODO comments from 2 years ago

**Examples of good comments needed:**
```javascript
// ❌ Bad: obvious comment
i++; // increment i

// ✅ Good: explains why
// We add 1 because API uses 1-indexed pages
const apiPageNumber = currentPage + 1;

// ✅ Good: explains complex business logic
// Discount rate calculation follows IRS Schedule C rules:
// - Under $10k: no discount
// - $10k-$50k: 5% discount
// - Over $50k: 10% discount plus 2% for every additional $10k

3. Architecture overview (understand structure)
4. Contributing guide (maintain quality)
5. Runbooks (handle incidents)
6. Everything else

**Be specific:**
- Point to specific missing documentation
- Explain impact of missing docs (time wasted, bugs shipped)
- Estimate effort to create/fix
- Provide examples of what good docs look like
