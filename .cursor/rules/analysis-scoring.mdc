# Code Review Scoring Rubric

Use this scoring system for all critical code reviews.

## Scoring Scale (1-5)

### 5 - Excellent
- Follows best practices consistently
- Well-tested with meaningful coverage
- Clear, maintainable code
- Properly documented
- Production-ready with no reservations
- **Example**: "This is how it should be done"

### 4 - Acceptable
- Minor issues that don't block production
- Mostly follows best practices
- Adequate testing
- Some tech debt but manageable
- **Example**: "Ship it, but file tickets for improvements"

### 3 - Needs Improvement
- Notable issues that accumulate tech debt
- Inconsistent patterns
- Testing gaps in non-critical areas
- Will cause maintenance burden
- **Example**: "Works, but future you will be annoyed"

### 2 - Major Issues
- Causes incidents in production
- Significant technical debt
- Poor performance or scalability
- Hard to maintain or extend
- **Example**: "This will wake people up at 3am"

### 1 - Critical Problems
- Blocks production deployment
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data loss risks
- System instability
- **Example**: "Do not ship this"

## Review Areas

Rate each area and provide specific examples:

### 1. Architecture & Design

### 2. Code Quality
**Score: ___**
- SOLID violations:
- Complexity hotspots (cyclomatic >10):
- Code smells (god classes, long functions):
- Top 3 refactors needed:

### 3. Security
**Score: ___**
- Vulnerabilities found:
- Attack vectors:
- Dependency risks:
- Critical fixes required:

### 4. Performance & Scalability
**Score: ___**
- Bottlenecks identified:
- Scalability limits:
- Breaking points at scale:
- Quick wins vs. major refactors:

### 5. Testing
**Score: ___**
- Critical paths without coverage:
- False confidence areas:
- Testing strategy gaps:
- Top 5 untested risks:

### 6. Technical Debt
**Score: ___**
- Accumulated shortcuts:
- Outdated dependencies:
- "Temporary" solutions:
- Top 5 must-fix items:

### 7. Documentation
**Score: ___**
- Missing critical docs:

## Overall Assessment Template

**Average Score: ___**

**Production Ready?** ☐ YES  ☐ NO  ☐ CONDITIONAL

**Biggest Risk:**
- 

**Must Fix Before Ship (P0):**
- 

**First Week Production Problems (P1):**
- 

**Accumulating Tech Debt (P2):**
- 

**Confidence Level (1-10):** ___

**Would I bet my on-call rotation on this?** ☐ YES  ☐ NO

## Prioritized Action Items

### P0 - Blocks Ship
1. 
2. 
3. 

### P1 - Causes Incidents
1. 
2. 
3. 

### P2 - Accumulates Debt
1. 
2. 
3. 

## Acceptance Criteria

- **Minimum score to ship**: 4+ on Security, Performance, Testing
- **Acceptable average**: 3.5+ overall
- **No P0 issues** can remain
- **P1 issues** require mitigation plan
- **P2 issues** should be tracked and scheduled
