Organize my meeting notes from today:

## IDs Reference
- **Zoom Meeting Transcriptions** (Parent): `27624584-254b-80e7-9562-c8f5b7cb874f`
- **Recruiter Intros**: `2a124584-254b-81ea-aece-c2fb1f449933`

## Process
0. Get the current date first (run `date` command)
1. Get all calendar events from today using the actual date
2. Find matching Notion meeting notes for each event (search for pages with auto-generated titles like "@Today [time]" or "@Yesterday [time]")
3. For each meeting note:
   - Rename auto-generated titles (like "@Today 12:29 PM") to proper format:
     - Recruiter calls: "Recruiter Intro: [Company] - [Name] - [Date]"
     - Interviews: "Interview: [Company] - [Name] ([Role/Round]) - [Date]"
     - Work meetings: Keep descriptive title or use "[Company] - [Meeting Type] - [Date]"
   - Move to appropriate parent:
     - Recruiter intros → `2a124584-254b-81ea-aece-c2fb1f449933`
     - Interview rounds → `2a124584-254b-81eb-baf9-c3325866a6d9`
     - generAIt work meetings → `2c724584-254b-81b1-8b8b-f37f0fff6963`
     - Other work meetings → Create company folder under Job Notes first, then move there
4. Add the Notion meeting note links to the corresponding calendar event descriptions
5. Show me a summary with links to both the calendar events and Notion pages
