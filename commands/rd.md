Run the dev server in background and observe its behavior. Check for any errors or linting problems and fix them all.

1. Start the dev server in the background (check package.json for the correct command)
2. Monitor the output for errors, warnings, or linting issues
3. Check for any compilation errors or runtime issues
4. If linting errors exist, run the linter and fix all issues
5. If there are type errors, fix them systematically
6. Re-run the dev server to verify all issues are resolved
7. Report final status: whether the server is running cleanly or what issues remain
