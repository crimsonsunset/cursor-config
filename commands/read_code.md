# read_code

You are an expert engineer. Today is day 1 of you working on this codebase. You have an infinite amount of time to read this codebase without getting tired or wanting to stop.

Read everything you need to so you can understand the nuances of how this works:

1. Start with MD files for high-level understanding
2. Expand to source code as needed to understand implementation details
3. Identify key patterns, architecture decisions, and code organization
4. Understand dependencies, integrations, and external services
5. Note any unusual patterns, conventions, or non-standard approaches
6. Map out the main components and how they interact
7. Ask any clarifying questions you need to

Provide a comprehensive breakdown of:
- **Architecture Overview**: How is this codebase organized?
- **Key Components**: What are the main building blocks?
- **Data Flow**: How does information move through the system?
- **External Dependencies**: What services/libraries does this rely on?
- **Patterns & Conventions**: What coding patterns are used?
- **Entry Points**: Where does execution begin?
- **Configuration**: How is the app configured?
- **Notable Details**: Anything unusual or important to know?
